## Preview

Welcome to **Bowling Alley** iOS project repository!

This is an open-source project for a bowling scoreboard calculator. 
The app was developed with TDD in mind, so that every user journey and every edge case would be covered. 
Working with SwiftUI really pushed me to discover it's pros and cons. I'll be back and finish the main screen someday.

##  TODO

*Disclaimer*
Project is far from complete. Probably will be finished later date!
This is the list of tasks that are left to do:
- Layout for displaying frames,
- Layout for leaderboard screen,
- Logic for starting and finishing the game,
- Saving finished games to local storage,
- Cool animations.
